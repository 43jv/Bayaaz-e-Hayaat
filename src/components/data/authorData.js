She worked for the party for few years staying underground (In Bandar, Eluru, Puri, Raichur), Later, she completed matriculation and joined polytechnic while participating in various literary events. Her writings tell us about the movements, its lows and highs and the difficulties faced by ordinary activists.Reading her accounts, we find that the history of left movement largely has been that of upper caste Hindu men. Differences in the lives of women while in the movement and out, were far more stark than men, since they invested more in terms of lifestyle and aspirations. This is an extremely painful process and has not been written about, and this is what we can read in the silences of Koteswaramma’s text.`
