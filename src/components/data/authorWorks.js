      engInfo: `<strong> Aiwan-e-Ghazal </strong> (trans. The Palace of Ghazal) is a 1976 novel by <a href="/archive/Jeelani%20Bano" target="_blank"> Jeelani Bano</a>. Set in the twilight of the British Raj and early years of independence in India, the story unfolds in the stratified feudal society of the erstwhile Hyderabad state. Depicting the impact of Hyderabad’s political instability, land reform, urbanisation, and assimilation on a wide array of caste-class groups, the main themes of the book are feudal oppression and the transformation of Urdu language and literature in the aftermath of national independence. The women, including the titular character, are the focus of the novel, and live their lives in the zenana of the nobility as well as the rural uprisings that challenged it. Punctuated by a collection of ghazals, amatory Urdu poems, the narrative disrupts the monotholic conception of Hyderabadi Muslims and describes the decline of Urdu literary culture and the political prestige of the ruling class. The book’s publication marks an important moment in modern Urdu literature from the Deccan.`,

      engInfo: `<strong> Baarish-e-Sang </strong> (trans. Rainfall of Stones) is a 1985 novel by <a href="/archive/Jeelani%20Bano" target="_blank">Jeelani Bano</a>. The story is set in the erstwhile Nizam’s state of Hyderabad in the 1940s during the fever-pitch of the Telangana peasant uprisings and political transformations. With central themes of exploitation by and liberation from a feudal gentry, the novel sees a young boy struggling against the chains of both bonded labour in the villages and capitalist servitude in the cities. Best read in conjunction with Bano’s first novel Aiwan-e-Ghazal, Baarish-e-Sang explores feudalism, patriarchy, violence, subjugation, and the fight for freedom as a “rainfall of stones” during a formative moment in India’s lesser-known history.`,

      engInfo: `<strong> Yaadash Bakhair </strong> is a 1989 collection of khaaka (pen-portraiture) and tanz-o-mizah (satire and humour) essays authored by <a href="/archive/Fatima%20Alam%20Ali" target="_blank">Fatima Alam Ali</a>. The title of the collection is Persian for “May God preserve them,” or “Good remembrance,” and the essays within are appropriately based on Ali’s memories of contemporary figures in Hyderabadi society. These begin with her fond yet uneasy memories of her own father Qazi Abdul Ghaffar, a Progressive writer and journalist, for whose influence she is both grateful and self-conscious. The following essays are based on her memories of Agha Hyder Hussain, her father’s friend from Aligarh, Islamic scholar Habib ur-Rehman, her girlhood friend and Urdu literary stalwart Qurratulain Hyder, her revered and maternal Urdu teacher Razia Sajjad Zaheer, and Progressive Urdu poet Makhdoom Mohiuddin. Her most significant and exhaustive recollection is an essay titled Adabi Mehfil or “Literary Gathering,” which explores her memories of a mushayrah, a poetry recitation event, at her father’s home in 1945 and sees her characterise the luminaries she has grown up around. Running through the collection is the overarching theme of the nature of memory, its mischief, subjectivity, unreliability, and specificity.`,

Then, they see a brahmin, who is offering free buttermilk to people who pass by and also giving them opportunity to sit and relax in shade. However when the couple approaches him, they are shooed out because they are dalits and are warned not to touch anything. They try to get one glass of water from somewhere but they are chased out by brahmins living around saying that dalits roaming around in the street is a crime and that the couple almost deceived them into giving water. When they are chased out of the village, Annapurna faints. Bhaskar(husband) feels hopeless that how these people think of themselves as if they are god.

      engInfo: `It is the story of a woman named Arundhati, who is portrayed as a stoic mother, wife and mother-in-law. The story starts with the debate of where arundhati and her husband suryanarayana should stay. Their children, Karuna and ravi debate on who should take them. Lata and Mohan are the daughter-in-law and son-in-law respectively. Mohan asks suryanarayana also to come with them to his house to live with Karuna and him. However, suryanarayana refuses to come stating his reason of staying in married daughter’s house is not proper. However in all of this discussion arundhati is silent and suryanarayana keeps rebuking her for it, that she isnt expressing her desire to stay with him. Lata keeps observing the situation paying special attention to arundhati. Lata keeps comparing her mother with arundhati. She observes how different her relationship is with her mother versus the relationship of Ravi and Arundhati. When she asks Ravi about it, he says she has always been like that, detached and uncaring. Lata doesnt think it is a good enough explanation. The arguments of where to stay kept continuing through out the lunch. After suryanarayana is asleep thinking arundhati wouldnt go anywhere leaving him, she tries to find keys to her cabinet in attempts of committing a suicide with sleeping pills in the cabinet. She desperately tries finding keys which are with Lata. Lata stops arundhati and tells her she wouldnt give her all the sleeping pills but just one. She tries to ask arundhati why she wouldnt speak out on whats going on with her. Arundhati recalls all the times when her husband mistreated her, cheating on her but she had to look like she was living a happy life for the children and how she stopped from killing herself before just because of children. When Lata embraces Arundhati, all her pain and anguish flows through in the form of tears.`,

She says that Sudha’s mother has to appear strict, but would understand if Sudha is absolutely sure of something. She says that people often dont actively try to create an atmosphere for women to think progressively, so sudha should take a step forward to educate and communicate with her mother.

      engInfo: `This story is about a woman who goes to her friend’s ancestral house to stay for a few days during summer. She is asked to stay at her friend’s late aunt’s room. In the room she discovers an old table with a drawer with two stacks of letters. One stack of letters addressed to her and the other sent by her to a man. In one of the letters she received from the man, he expresses his sorrow about sending back all the letters he received from the aunt. He thinks that the aunt is doubting herself for sending messages to a strange man and has now changed her mind which is why she is asking the letters back. However, as per her wish, he sends her all the letters. As a reply to this message, the aunt then says that she doesn’t feel safe enough if the letters are with him and that she will be the only one blamed if someone finds the letters. She says that she has never once doubted her love towards him and that she just feels that all the letters will be safer with her. Even if in any case her husband does find the letters, she says that he will be too proud to tell anyone about his wife cheating on him. That will hurt his ego and something like this is not a problem that a man can share with his friends or family so the secret will never be out. These letters entirely change the perception of the woman towards the aunt and she feels like hid in the shadows behind the face of a dutiful wife who was always known for her good deeds, were the faces of selfishness, cunningness and hypocrisy.`,

      engInfo: `The story revolves around the thoughts of a middle class, uneducated, homemaker. One night, she is unable to sleep and the thoughts that cross her mind throughout the night form the plot of this story. She is forced to cancel plans with her own friend that morning to attend a drama performed by her husband's friend against her wishes. The husband even uses the money that she has been saving to buy a saree that she has been longing for to buy the tickets to this drama. When she disagrees to accompany him to the drama saying that she has prior plans, he says that he too had planned this in prior and assumes that his commitments have more value than hers. He even goes a step ahead and makes fun of the woman’s friendship saying that all they ever talk about revolves around what happens in the kitchen. She feels helpless, sad and angry at how her choices are not given any importance. It is always his favourite book, his friends, and his choice of music that are given priority. Her friend is given ‘permission’ to go out after a lot of fighting and pleading and cancelling plans with her would mean waiting for eternity till she gets permission to go out again. With all this in mind as she finally manages to fall asleep her husband wakes her up asking for coffee. With a little hesitation she agrees and as they walk out of the bedroom it never occurs to her husband to ask her about her weary eyes and it never occurs to the wife to tell him about her sleeplessness and what she went through that night. She gives him the coffee and he gets to reading his morning newspaper as usual.`,

She has only one friend at this new place who is described as someone who keeps to herself and sings melancholy songs. The young girl, however, enjoys going to the beach and exploring the huge garden in front of her house. She often thinks about the holidays she spent at her maternal grandmother's house and how she got close to her grandmother and shared her deepest secrets only with her during those days. She was surprised that her grandmother was the only person who could convince her dad to let her stay for a few days. However, that happiness is short-lived and she is brought back to live in this strange place that she doesn’t like much. One day, the worker at her place comes to her mother and gives her some news upon hearing which her mother breaks down. When she asks her mother what was wrong, her mother wipes her tears and acts like nothing is wrong and asks her to go and play in the garden. Nothing in that garden interested her that day. Everything felt gloomy. She somehow felt like her grandmother passed away and there was no way she could meet her again. But her mother drowned herself in work and acted normal, wiping her tears off whenever she saw her. The little girl couldn’t take it anymore. She hugs her mother and cries her heart out saying she misses her grandmother. The mother consoles her and tells her that she does not like the new place either and they would go back to their old village. The girl is taken aback by that and felt like the little happiness of the garden, beach and her friend’s songs would also become a memory like the stories her grandmother used to tell her.`,

One fine day her neighbour invites her to an all woman meeting and as she has nothing better to do she accompanies the neighbour thinking this would be a nice opportunity to get to know a few people in the neighbourhood. She goes there and is taken aback by the grandeur of their meeting place and finds a lot of woman leaders debating and giving speeches, arguing about what needs to be done to fight for their rights in such a patriarchal society. They conclude the meeting with an agreement to participate in a strike till their demands are met. They decide not to do any kind of household work as a part of the strike. And since they would not be cooking, they would also have to stay hungry till the strike ends. The woman is unwillingly forced to participate in the strike and she is taken along with a group of other women to go from house to house and make sure everyone participates in the strike. After 3 days of struggle the men in the village meet and agree to accept the demands put forward by the women. The woman leaders are overjoyed and celebrate their victory. During the celebratory speech the woman stands up and innocently asks what the demands of the strike were. Though the leaders are taken aback, they proceed to explain when all the women agree that they too were clueless about the demands of the strike they just participated in. The leader then tells them that they had asked for 8hrs of rest from household work everyday and 3-4 days of leave per month. The woman starts laughing and points out that these demands were indeed very pointless and that the strike was a waste of time as they get 8hrs of rest everyday when they sleep at night and 3-4 days break every month during their menstrual cycle. The educated leader finds herself speechless at this perspective of the uneducated woman`,

The Madrasi however, makes friends with everyone in the ship and behaves as if he knows about everything under the sky. The Madrasi once enters into an argument with Mr. Rao, regarding a chain worn by Mrs. Rao. While Mr. Rao says that the chain is made of fake pearls, the Madrasi argues that the pearls are natural and very valuable. They enter into a bet for 400 rupees. The Madrasi examines the chain. He appears to have found the pearls as natural. But, looking at Mrs. Rao’s pleading eyes, he does not reveal the truth. He accepts that the pearls are fake and loses 400 rupees to Mr. Rao. The next day, he receives an envelope containing 400 rupees thrown into his cabin. It was from Mrs. Rao. Upon asking for explanation, the Madrasi tells the man that by looking at Mrs. Rao’s pleading eyes, he understands that the pearls were gifted by her lover who is obviously hidden from Mr. Rao. Mr. Rao had left his wife alone in Madras for 7 years and it was very obvious to the Madrasi as to what had happened when he looked at Mrs. Rao’s eyes the previous night. Thus, the Madrasi, who appears as a silly character in the beginning, due to his talkative nature, proves himself as a helping and kind-hearted person and the man starts liking him.`,
